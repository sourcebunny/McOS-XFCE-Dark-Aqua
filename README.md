# McOS-XFCE-Dark-Aqua

<img src="images/preview.png" width="800" />

This is a fork of paullinuxthemer's McOS-CTLina-XFCE-Dark theme.

The theme has been modified to look more similar to Snow Leopard.

The XFWM4 window decorations and borders are based on [lenovox's Leopard-round](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1015871) theme. I have modified those assets to be darker to match the McOS Dark theme.
